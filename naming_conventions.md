## Lesson Name Naming Conventions
- **All lessons must start with `L{n}`**, n is the lesson number, including 0, e.g. `L0 Getting Started.md`, `L1-2.md`
- If the lesson is a summary, overview or project, must follow the pattern `L{n} {Project/Summary/Overview}`, notice the **capitalization** of the first letter. e.g. `L1 Project.md`
- With the exception of Lesson 0 and overview, project, or summary, all lessons must follow with '-{m}', m is the sublesson number, e.g. `L1-1.md`, `L2-2 Exercise.md`
- If it's an exercise, must add ` Exercise`, `E` needs to be capitalized. e.g. `L1-1 Exercise.md`
- Because we use regex matching, it's very important that you follow these rules
